# ðŸŽ¨ My-Gallery

**My-Gallery** is a modern and interactive image gallery where each image starts in black and white (grayscale) and magically transforms into full color when hovered over or clicked. It's built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a touch of **JavaScript** to enhance the user experience.
